__Problem Statement:__

Your colleague has come to you for help, they have a broken Javascript function that is intended to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Your colleague needs it to calculate the first 50 numbers accurately starting with 0, they do not think it will need to calculate more than that based on the users requirements, and they have written some basic tests. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. 

Your task is to:

- Identify and fix the bugs in the given code.
- Optimize the function for better performance.
- Add any additional tests as required
- Ensure that the function returns the nth Fibonacci number as output.

The code can be found in `app.js`

__Constraints:__

1. The assessment must be completed within one hour.
2. The final solution must be a single function that takes an integer 'n' as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
3. The function should handle edge cases and throw an Error when necessary.
4. Your solution should work for n in the range of 0 to 49. 49 being the 50th Fibonacci number

__Scoring Criteria:__

Your submission will be graded based on the following metrics:

 - Correctness: The function should return the correct output for a given input.
-  Code Quality: The code should be clean, well-organized, and easy to understand.
 - Optimization: The function should demonstrate efficient use of resources and have an optimized time complexity.
 - Edge Case Handling: The function should handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages when necessary.
